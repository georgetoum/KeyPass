# 🔐 KeyPass

**KeyPass** is a secure, cross-platform password manager built with the Electron framework using **Java**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. It connects to **Google Firebase** to allow users to manage their own encrypted accounts — enabling them to **save**, **edit**, **delete**, **view**, and **generate** strong passwords securely.

> 📝 **Note:** This repository also contains a standalone C++ program (`code_4_password_manager.cpp`). It is **not related to the main KeyPass application**, but serves as a separate console-based password manager project.
